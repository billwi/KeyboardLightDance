# KeyboardLightDance
Let the lights on your keyboard dance (num lock, caps lock, and scroll lock)

A simple java program I wrote in my free time to toggle the 3 keyboard lights randomly.

My original intention was to make the lights look cool, however I realized it's a great troll.

Download the jar from releases.
